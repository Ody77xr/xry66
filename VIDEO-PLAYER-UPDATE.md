# Video Player Update - Standalone Player Page

## ✅ Problem Fixed

### **Issue:**
- Video player in modal/overlay was misaligned
- Play button and controls were not clickable
- Difficult to interact with embedded video
- Poor user experience on mobile

### **Solution:**
- Created dedicated standalone video player page
- Videos now redirect to full-page player
- Spacious layout with large embedded player
- Proper title, description, and metadata display
- Better mobile responsiveness

## 🎬 New Video Player Features

### **1. Standalone Page (xrvideo-player.html)**
- Full-page dedicated video viewing experience
- Large, properly sized video embed
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size
- Minimum 60vh height on desktop, 50vh on mobile

### **2. Video Information Display**
- **Title**: Large holographic text at top
- **Description**: Full description below video
- **Metadata**: Category, duration, date, view count
- **Tags**: All video tags displayed as badges
- **Video ID**: Shown in sidebar

### **3. Sidebar Info Panel**

### **5. Navigation**

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Before:**
```javascript
// Old: Modal overlay player
videoGallery.openVideoPlayer(video) 
  → Opens modal overlay
  → Video hard to click/interact with
```

### **After:**
```javascript
// New: Redirect to standalone page
videoGallery.openVideoPlayer(video)
  → Redirects to: xrvideo-player.html?id=EP001
  → Full page with proper layout
  → Easy to interact with
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

- 3-column grid layout (video + sidebar)
- Large video player (60vh minimum height)
- Related videos in 4-column grid

### **Tablet:**

- Video player 55vh height
- Related videos in 3-column grid

### **Mobile:**

## 🔒 Access Control Integration

The new player works seamlessly with the access control system:

1. **Free Videos**: Click → Redirect to player page immediately
2. **Locked Videos**: Click → Password/trial modal → On unlock → Redirect to player
3. **Preview System**: Still works (5 seconds preview, then lock)
4. **Master Unlock**: Unlocks all videos, then redirects to player

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **Created**: `xrvideo-player.html` - New standalone player page
